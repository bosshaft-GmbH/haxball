# Bosshaft Ball Color

A script to change ball color with a command or automatically.

## Changelog (last update: 30.09.2019)

[+] Non admin players are not able to use the command anymore.

[+] Implemented a version for automatically changing the color every second to random color values. You can comment it if you want to use only command version.

## How to run?

1. Copy all content
2. Open haxball.com/headless
3. Open Developer Console (F12 or CTRL + Shift + J)
4. Navigate to "Console" tab
5. Paste all of this code and solve the captcha
6. Do not close the page after it gives you link. 

### How to use?

1. In the game, press TAB or click chat
2. On chat write, !ball green and send.

Actually there is 2 way to use this script. One is defined ones. I defined 5 different color. (Red, Green, Blue, Black and Transparent)

You can use them by just writing a command like !ball red or !ball blue.

The other way to do is using custom codes. Instead of making red, blue or the ones I defined. Let's say you want to have pink ball color.

You need to write different command for this.

!customball 16363748

The 16363748 is code of our Pink color. (It's decimal value) Any decimal value you put here is gonna set as ball colour.

You can find any of the color's decimal value here: https://convertingcolors.com/
